code for micromouse that has to solve a maze in given time
This is the code for a maze solving robot, that we used, to participate in INternational Robotics Challenge, held by IIT Bombay.  The bot had to navigate through a maze in a dry run and map all of it and then in the main run, reach the end while traversing the shortest path. The logic used to solve this is mapping the maze in a ternary tree and then using DFS to form a spanning tree to get the dezired leaf(end point).
